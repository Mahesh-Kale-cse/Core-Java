Practice tasks:

1. WAP to print table of the number.
Solution:
	
	int n = 7;
		
	for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
		System.out.println(n*i);
	}
	
	for (int i = 9; i <= 90; i+=9) {
		System.out.println(i);
	}

2. WAP to add all the numbers between 20 to 25.
Solution:
	int sum = 0;
		
	for (int i = 20; i <= 25; i++) {
		sum = sum + i;
		//sum+=i;
	}
	
	System.out.println(sum);

3. WAP to find average of all the numbers between 35 to 39.
Solution:
	
	int sum = 0;
	int count = 0;
	
	for (int i = 35; i <= 39; i++) {
		sum = sum + i;
		count++;
	}
	
	System.out.println(sum / count);

Practice tasks:

1. Write a Java program using a for loop and if-else to print whether numbers from 1 to 20 are even or odd.

2. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 50. If a number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz', if divisible by 5 print 'Buzz', otherwise print the number itself.

3. Write a Java program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using a for loop and if-else conditions.

4. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop. Use if-else to handle the case when the number is 0 or 1.

5. Write a Java program to print the sum of even numbers and odd numbers separately between 1 to 100 using for loop and if-else.

6. Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 30, but if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'HelloWorld', if only by 3 print 'Hello', if only by 5 print 'World'.

7. Write a program using for loop and if-else to count how many numbers between 1 and 200 are divisible by 7.

8. Write a program to reverse the digits of a given number using for loop and if-else conditions.

9. Write a Java program that prints the multiplication table of a number using a for loop. Use if-else to skip printing multiples of 5.

10. Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100. Use if-else to print 'Even Square' if the square of the number is even, and 'Odd Square' if the square is odd.

A. Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, print a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".
For example:
alarmClock(1, false) → "7:00"
alarmClock(5, false) → "7:00"
alarmClock(0, false) → "10:00"

B. We are having a party with amounts of tea and candy. Print the int outcome of the party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, or 2=great. A party is good (1) if both tea and candy are at least 5. However, if either tea or candy is at least double the amount of the other one, the party is great (2). However, in all cases, if either tea or candy is less than 5, the party is always bad (0).
For example:
teaParty(6, 8) → 1
teaParty(3, 8) → 0
teaParty(20, 6) → 2

Q. What is Abstract class? Or Define Abstract class.
A. The Abstract class is the class which contains both type of methods, normal as well as abstract.

Normal class -> normal methods
Interface -> abstract methods
Abstract class -> normal methods + abstract methods

Q. What is the need of Abstract class?
A. Whenever we need to host both types of methods under the same roof, we must use abstract class.

Syntax of abstract class:
accessSpecifier abstract class class_name {

}

Example of abstract class:
public abstract class Car {
	
	public void m1() {
		
	}
	
	public abstract void m2();
}

Bullet points:

1. We can not instantiate the abstract class.

2. The abstract class must have child class.

3. The abstract class is extended in its child class.

4. The abstract class can have multiple normal methods and multiple abstract methods.

5. We can not achieve multiple inheritance using abstract class.

6. The abstract class can not be declared as final.
Proof:
public final abstract class Vehicle {
	
	public void m3() {
		
	}
	
	public abstract void m4();
}
//Error: The class Vehicle can be either abstract or final, not both
Note:
A. final variable -> it can not change the value.
B. final method -> it can not be overridden.
C. final class -> it can not be inherited.

Homework:

1. Interface Vs abstract class
2. Normal class Vs abstract class

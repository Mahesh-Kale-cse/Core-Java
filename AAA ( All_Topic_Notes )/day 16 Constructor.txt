Meaning of Constructor - The one who constructs/creates

Meaning of Constructor in Java - The one who constructs/creates object from the class.

PAN Card = class
Photo copies = objects
Xerox machine = Constructor

Q. What is Constructor? OR Define Constructor.
A. The Constructor is special method with name same as class name and with no return type; not even void.
For example:
public class Car {

	public void show() {
		System.out.println("This is normal method.");
	}
	
	public Car() {
		System.out.println("This is constructor.");
	}
}

Q. What are types of Constructor?
A. There are 3 types of constructors in Java as parameterized, non-parameterized and default.

Note:
There is huge difference between non-parameterized and default constructor.

parameterized constructor = constructor with parameters
written by developer

non-parameterized constructor = constructor without parameters
written by developer

default constructor = constructor without parameters
written by System

Syntax of Constructor:

accessSpecifier class_name(parameters) {

}

Examples of Constructor:

	public Car() {
		System.out.println("This is constructor.");
	}

	public Car(int n) {
		System.out.println("This is constructor.");
	}

Normal method Vs Constructor:

1. return type
2. name
3. types
4. calling fashion - normal method needs object for getting called
whereas the constructor needs new keyword to get called.
5. motive

Q. Why to use Constructor?
A. To create objects from the class and to initialize their instance variables.

For example:
public class Car {

	public String name;
	public String color;
	
	public Car() {
		name = "Innova";
		color = "Gray";
	}
	
	public Car(String n, String c) {
		name = n;
		color = c;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car c = new Car();
		System.out.println(c.name);
		System.out.println(c.color);
	}
}

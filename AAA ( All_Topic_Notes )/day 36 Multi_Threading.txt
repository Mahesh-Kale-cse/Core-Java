The sleep method is the in built and static method in Thread class.
It causes the currently executing thread to sleep.
The thread sleeps means temporarily ceases its execution.
It sleeps for specified number of milliseconds.
Note: 1 second = 1000 milliseconds

For example:

public class Spotify extends Thread {
		
	@Override
	public void run() {
		
		try {
			for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
				System.out.println("Playing song...");
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
		}
	}
}

The Runnable is in built interface in java.lang package.

To achieve threading mechanism in a class which is already extending some another class.

For example:
class Car {

}

class Breeza extends Car implements Runnable {

}

name of thread

Each thread has a name. To identify it.
By default thread name is given as thread-0, thread-1, thread-2, ..... 
We can customize the name of the thread.
The name is private variable of the Thread class and hence it can be accessed using its getter and setter methods.

For example:
	Spotify s = new Spotify();
	s.setName("Music Player");
	System.out.println(s.getName());

priority of thread:

Each thread has priority. The range is 1 to 10. The default value is 5.
The priority is also private variable of the Thread class and hence it can be accessed using its getter and setter methods.

For example:
	Spotify s = new Spotify();
	s.setPriority(8);
	System.out.println(s.getPriority());

Note: If we set the priority of the thread to some out of range value then we get IllegalArgumentException.
For example:
	Spotify s = new Spotify();
	s.setPriority(18);
Output:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
	at java.base/java.lang.Thread.setPriority(Thread.java:1138)
	at a.b.c.Demo.main(Demo.java:8)

The daemon thread is the thread which is immortal thread.
That means this thread can not be terminated.

We can make our thread as daemon thread.
We need to call setDaemon method as:
	Spotify s = new Spotify();
	s.setDaemon(true);

We can check any thread if it is daemon thread or not.
We need to call isDaemon method as:
	Spotify s = new Spotify();
	System.out.println(s.isDaemon());

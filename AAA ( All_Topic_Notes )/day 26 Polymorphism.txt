Overriding -> Replace old by new

Method Overriding -> Replace old method by new method

Syntax of Method Overriding:
public class Father {
	
	public void bike() {
		System.out.println("Scooter");
	}
}

public class Son extends Father {

	@Override
	public void bike() {
		System.out.println("Bullet Classic 350");
	}
}

Q. How to do Method Overriding?
A. Same name and same parameters but in child class.

Note:
Method Overloading:
Same name
Different parameters

Method Overriding:
Same name
Same parameters
Inheritance

Q. Can constructor be overloaded?
A. Yes.

Q. Can constructor be overridden?
A. No.

Note:
The constructor can be overloaded but can not be overridden.

The Method Overloading is not dependent on Inheritance.
That means, the Method Overloading can be achieved with or without Inheritance.

The Method Overriding is dependent on Inheritance.
That means, the Method Overriding can be achieved with Inheritance only.

The @Override is Annotation.
The Annotation concept was introduced in Java 1.5.
The most of the annotations start with @ symbol.
They provide some extra information to the developer.

There are 3 levels of annotations:
1. class level
2. method level
3. variable level

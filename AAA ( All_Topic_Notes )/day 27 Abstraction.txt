The Abstraction has 2 parts as follows
1. interfaces
2. abstract class

Q. What is abstract method?
A. The method with no body.

Syntax of abstract method:
accessSpecifier abstract returnType method_name(parameters);

Examples of abstract method:
public abstract void show();

Q. Why to write abstract method?
A. Whenever we don't know concrete definition of the method, we must make it abstract.

Q. Why to write normal method?
A. Whenever we know concrete definition of the method, we must make it normal.

Q. What is interface? OR Define interface.
A. The interface is collection of variables and abstract methods.

Q. Why do we need interface?
A. To host abstract methods.

Q. Why do we need class?
A. To host normal methods.

Q. What is the Syntax of interface?
A.
	accessSpecifier interface interface_name {
	
	}

Q. What is the example of interface?
A.
	public interface Car {
	
	}

Note: The class & interface are totally different.
Proof:
Q. What is class? OR Define class.
A. The class is collection of variables and normal methods.

Q. What is interface? OR Define interface.
A. The interface is collection of variables and abstract methods.

The interface can not be instantiated.

Core Java:
instance = object
To instantiate = To create object

Note: Using classes, we can not achieve multiple inheritance but using interfaces we can achieve it.

Homework:
1. Functional interface
2. Marker interface (OR Tagged interface)

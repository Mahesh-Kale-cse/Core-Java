Q. What is Method?
A. The Method is block of code that is defined once and called multiple times.

Method Definition -> To tell the method, what to do
Method Call -> To use that method

Q. When to use methods?
A. Whenever we need to execute the same code again and again, we must go for the methods.

Q. Why to use methods?
A. To avoid the code repetition.

Syntax of Method Definition:

accessSpecifier keywords returnType method_name(parameters)
{

}

Examples of Method definition:
public void show()
{
	System.out.println("Hello World!");
}

public void display()
{
	System.out.println("Welcome User!");
}

public void add(int a, int b)
{
	System.out.println(a+b);
}

Syntax of Method Call:

class_name object_name = new class_name();
object_name.method_name();

Example of method call:

Demo d = new Demo();
d.display();
d.show();
d.add(5, 7);

Q. What are the types of methods?
A. parameterized & non-parameterized

parameterized methods = methods with parameters
non-parameterized = methods without parameters

For example:
//non-parameterized methods
public void display()
{
	System.out.println("Welcome User!");
}

//parameterized methods
public void add(int a, int b)
{
	System.out.println(a+b);
}

Practice Tasks:

1. WAM to print Hi on the console.

2. WAM to show addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers on the screen.

3. WAM to calculate factorial of a number.

4. WAM to display reverse of a number.

5. WAM to find and print AND operation of two boolean values.

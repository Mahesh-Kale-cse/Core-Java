Iterative statements = Repetitive statements = loops

If we want to execute some code again and again multiple times, then we must use loops.

Types of loops:
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
4. for each loop

Syntax of for loop:

	for(initialization; condition; updates)
	{
		n no of LOC
	}

Example of for loop:

	for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello!");
	}
	
	System.out.println("Outside!");

Output:
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Outside!

Codes:

1. for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
		
		System.out.println("Outside!");
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Outside!

2. for(int i = 68; i <= 72; i++)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
Output:
68
69
70
71
72

3. for(int i = 10; i <= 100; i+=10)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
Output:
10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80
90
100

4. for(char i = 'A'; i <= 'Z'; i++)
		{
			System.out.print(i + " ");
		}
Output:
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 

5. for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i--)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
Output:
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1

6. 	for(int i = 10; i >= 1; i++)
	{
		System.out.println(i);
	}
Output:
10
11

7. 
	for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
	{
		if(i == 5)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
Output: 5

8. 
	for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
	{
		if(i%2 == 0)
		{
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
Output:

9.
	for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
		{
			if(i >= 4)
			{
				System.out.println(i);
			}
		}
Output:
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

10.
	for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
		{
			if(i%4 == 0)
			{
				System.out.println(i + " is completely divisible by 4");
			}
			else
			{
				System.out.println(i + " is NOT completely divisible by 4");
			}
		}
Output:
1 is NOT completely divisible by 4
2 is NOT completely divisible by 4
3 is NOT completely divisible by 4
4 is completely divisible by 4
5 is NOT completely divisible by 4
6 is NOT completely divisible by 4
7 is NOT completely divisible by 4
8 is completely divisible by 4
9 is NOT completely divisible by 4
10 is NOT completely divisible by 4

Bullet points:

1. We can write any version of if else, switch case inside the for loop.

2. The nested for loop is allowed.

3. The condition is checked multiple times.

4. The body of the for loop is executed if the condition returns true.

5. After every iteration, the control goes to the updates.

6. After updates, the control goes to check the condition.

7. The for loop can lead to infinite iterations.

8. The initialization happens only once and that too in the beginning of the loop.

Practice tasks:

1. WAP to print table of the number.

2. WAP to add all the numbers between 20 to 25.

3. WAP to find average of all the numbers between 35 to 39.

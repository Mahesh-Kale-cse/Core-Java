The Scanner is in built class in Java in java.util package.

The major usage of this class is to accept input from the user.

Sample code 1:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Home {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("Enter number: ");
		
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		
		System.out.println("You enetered " + n);
	}
}

Note:

A. The Scanner class has dedicated methods for accepting different types of input.
For example:
To accept byte, we have method nextByte()
To accept short, we have method nextShort()
To accept int, we have method nextInt()
To accept long, we have method nextLong()
To accept float, we have method nextFloat()
To accept double, we have method nextDouble()
To accept boolean, we have method nextBoolean()
To accept character, we have method next().charAt(0)
To accept String, we have method nextLine()

B. To accept multiple inputs, only single object of Scanner class is created.
For example:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Home {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		System.out.println("Enter name: ");
		String name = sc.nextLine();
		
		System.out.println("Enter phone: ");
		long phone = sc.nextLong();
		
		System.out.println("Enter ht: ");
		float ht = sc.nextFloat();
		
		System.out.println(name + " " + phone + " " + ht);
	}
}

Practice Tasks:

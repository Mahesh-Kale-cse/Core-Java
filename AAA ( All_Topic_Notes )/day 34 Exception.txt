Q. What is Exception? OR Define Exception.
A. The Exception is unwanted situation which terminates the code without giving expected output.

Q. What is Exception Handling?
A. To manage that unwanted situation.

Q. Why to handle exception?
A. To generate the expected output

Q. How to handle exception?
A. try catch finally throw throws

try block -> Risky code: The code that might get exceptions

catch block -> Exception handling code

finally block -> The code to execute by default

throw keyword -> To throw exception explicitly in the code

throws keyword -> To inform the JVM about upcoming exception

Q. What is Exception Hierarchy?
A. Throwable class -> Exception class -> Multiple child classes of Exception class.
The Exception is in built class in Java in java.lang package.

Q. What are types of Exceptions?
A. Compile-time and Runtime.
Note:
Compile-time Exceptions are also called as Checked Exceptions.
Runtime Exceptions are also called as Unchecked Exceptions.

The throw is used to invite the Exception in the code explicitly.
For example:
package a.b.c;

public class Demo {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException {
		
		StringIndexOutOfBoundsException obj = new StringIndexOutOfBoundsException();
		throw obj;
		
	}
}

Note:
The throw keyword is generally used with the Custom Exceptions.
The Custom Exceptions are the Exceptions customized according to the requirements.

For example:
public class LowBalanceException extends Exception {

}

public class Demo {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		try {
			LowBalanceException obj = new LowBalanceException();
			throw obj;
		} catch (LowBalanceException e) {
			System.out.println("Send Mail & SMS");
		}
		
	}
}

The throws doesn't handle any exception using try catch block. It only informs the JVM about the upcoming exception.

For example:
package a.b.c;

public class Demo {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException {
		
		String str = "Vishal";
		System.out.println(str.charAt(25));
		
	}
}

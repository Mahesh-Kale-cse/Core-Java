The methods which return any value do NOT mention void as their return type.

The method which return any value has return statement in their body.

We can receive or collect the data returned by a method.

If we do not need the value returned by the method, we can skip collecting it in a variable.

We can NOT receive or collect the data from a method with return type as void.

Returning a value and parameters are totally independent of each other.
For example:

m1 -> No parameters and not retuning any value.
m2 -> No parameters but retuning a value.
m3 -> With parameters and not returning a value.
m4 -> With parameters but returning a value.

parameter = gift
return value = return gift

The method can return any type of data independent of data type of parameters.
For example:
	public String vishal(int num) {
		
		if(num == 0)
			return "Zero";
		else if(num > 0)
			return "Positive";
		else
			return "Negative";
		
	}

	public boolean aniket(int n) {
		if(n%2 == 0)
			return true;
		else
			return false;
	}

We can have n no of parameters to a method but we can return only single value.

We must collect the data in a variable of same data type which the method is returning.

While calling parameterized method, no of parameters, data type of parameters and sequence of parameters must match.

Practice tasks:

1. WAM to return ASCII value of a character passed as a parameter.

2. WAM to return average of 5 numbers passed as a parameter.

3. WAM to return true if the number passed as a parameter is 2 digit else return false.

4. WAM to return "Success" if the number passed as a parameter is 1234 else return "Failed".

5. WAM to return "Valid" if the number passed as a parameter is even as well as 2 digit. Return "Invalid" otherwise.

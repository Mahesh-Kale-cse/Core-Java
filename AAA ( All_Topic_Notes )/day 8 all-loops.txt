Syntax of while loop:

	initialization;
	
	while(condition)
	{
		n no of LOC
		updates
	}

Examples of while loop:

	int i = 1;
		
	while(i <= 5)
	{
		System.out.println(i);
		i++;
	}

Syntax of do-while loop:
	
	initialization;
	
	do
	{
		n no of LOC
		updates
	}
	while(condition);

Examples of do-while loop:
	
	int i = 1;
		
	do
	{
		System.out.println(i);
		i++;
	}
		while(i <= 5);

Note:

1. The for and while loops are called as Entry controlled loops or pre-condition loops.

2. The do-while loop is called as Exit controlled loop or post-condition loop.

3. The do-while loop executes at least once.

Agenda of tomorrow:
Nested loops
break statement
continue statement
flag system

Code 1:

	int n;
		for (int i = 12; i <= 15; i++) {
			n = i;
			while(n != 0) {
				System.out.print(n%10);
				n = n / 10;
			}
			System.out.println();
		}

Code 2:

        for(int n = 381; n != 0; n = n / 10)
		{
			System.out.print(n % 10);
		}

Code 3:

	int n = 381;
		
		do {
			System.out.print(n % 10);
			n = n / 10;
		}
		while (n != 0);

Code 4:

        int n = 381;
		
		while (n != 0) {
			System.out.print(n % 10);
			n = n / 10;
		}

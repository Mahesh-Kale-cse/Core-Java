Meaning of Encapsulation in Java:
Binding together logically related data.
For example:

public class Fruit {
	//We take following variables - logically related data
	public String name, color, taste, type, price, shape, season;

	//We do NOT take following variables - logically not related data
	public String address, desg, salary;
}

getter method -> the method which gets the value of variable.

setter method -> the method which sets the value of variable.

The getter method is always non-parameterized.
The setter method is always parameterized.

The getter method always returns a value.
The setter method never returns a value.

The getter and setter method always follow camel case.

The getter and setter method are always public.

Q. What is need of getter and setter method?

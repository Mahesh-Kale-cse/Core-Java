Q. What is Collection Framework? OR Define Collection Framework
A. The Collection Framework is the collection of multiple in built classes and interfaces.

Q. What are advantages of Collection Framework?
A. No limitations on data type, No limitations on size, Many in built powerful methods

Q. What is Collection Hierarchy?
A. Collection interface -> Set, Queue, List, Map, ...

Set -> Maintains unique elements only, no duplicates are allowed
Queue -> Maintains FCFS order
List -> Stores the elements for random storage
Map -> Stores data in Key-Value pairs

The Set is in built interface in java.util package.
It is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.
That means it maintains or saves only unique elements.

The famous implementations of Set interface are:
HashSet -> maintains random order
LinkedHashSet -> maintains insertion order
TreeSet -> maintains sorted order

Methods in Set interface:
add, remove, clear, size

Sample code:
HashSet<Object> s = new HashSet<Object>();
		
		s.add(21);
		s.add(true);
		s.add('D');
		s.add("Success");
		s.add(21);
		s.add(3.1416F);
		
		System.out.println(s.size());//5
		System.out.println(s);
		s.remove('D');
		System.out.println(s.size());//4
		System.out.println(s);

Pending for tomorrow:
Queue interface - practical

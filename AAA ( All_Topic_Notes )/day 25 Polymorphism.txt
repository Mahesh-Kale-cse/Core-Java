Meaning of Polymorphism:
Many forms or versions of a thing

Meaning of Polymorphism in Java:
Many forms or versions of a method

Q. What are the types of Polymorphism?
A. Static Polymorphism & Dynamic Polymorphism

Static Polymorphism = Compile time Polymorphism = Early Binding = Method Overloading
Dynamic Polymorphism = Runtime Polymorphism = Late Binding = Method Overriding

Overloading:
Putting extra load beyond the limit

Truck Overloading:
Putting extra load beyond the limit on trucks

Method Overloading:
Putting extra load beyond the limit on methods
Defining multiple times

Syntax and flow of Method Overloading:

public class Home {
	
	public void add(int a, int b) {
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}
	
	public void add(int a, int b, int c) {
		System.out.println(a+b+c);
	}
	
	public void add(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
		System.out.println(a+b+c+d);
	}
}

Bullet points:

1. Overloading = Normal task + Extra task(s)

2. The method with same names but different parameters are overloaded.

3. The method with same names and same parameters are duplicate.

4. The method can be overloaded n times.

5. The constructors can be overloaded.
For example:

public class Car {
	
	public String name;
	public String color;
	
	public Car() {
		System.out.println("Hi!");
	}
	
	public Car(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public Car(String name, String color) {
		this.name = name;
		this.color = color;
	}
	
	
}

Q. Why to overload methods?
A. To group together logically similar methods.
A. To perform some common functionality in different ways.
